            <p>The Engage Pursuit Pro1 is the newest paddle in Engage's lineup.
                The paddle comes in 2 models, the 6.0 (16mm core) and the standard (13mm core).
                Engage has touted this new paddle as having a new power core, which theoretically should put it in the upper tier of power.
                Let's see how this new power core equates to gameplay on the court.
            </p>
            <h2>Power</h2>
            <img src="images/Pro1_2.JPG" alt="Pro1_Paddle_2" onclick="enlargeImage(this)">

            <p>This paddle has been touted to have a new power core compared to the older models, and this paddle rips.
                Drives were effortless with this paddle, and the ball comes off the face with a plush, springy feel.
                The paddle gets great spin, which helps the ball dip on harder topspin or roll shots.
                Drives and serves felt penetrating and reached the back of the court more often than not. 
                The throat is also supposed to grid on harder swings, which is supposed to give the paddle more power on larger swings.
                I did not notice the grid during gameplay, but I can grid the paddle slightly with my hands.
                Drives, serves, and overheads were not a problem with this paddle, and I never found I was wanting more power.
            </p>
            <p>The pop on this paddle is very high as well. I felt as though I could win hand battles more often due to the ball coming off the face faster.
                However, this isn't the poppiest paddle, which makes the pop more manageable than other pure power paddles, such as the Gearbox Pro Power or the Paddletek Bantam TKO.
            </p>
            <h2>Control</h2>
            <img src="images/Pro1_3.JPG" alt="Pro1_Paddle_3" onclick="enlargeImage(this)">

            <p>The control of this paddle was suprisingly better than I thought it would be.
                Due to the longer dwell time of the ball it gives you a bit more control on where you want to place your shots.
                Drops felt easy as did most dinks. The paddle also has a lower swingweight for it's shape, which makes it more maneuverable. However, this is far from a control paddle. 
                If you get caught out of position you can easily pop up the ball due to the springy face.
                I often pop up the ball more on resets because of how much energy is returned, which can often give my opponent an easier shot for a putaway.
                Mid-court resets were also difficult as it was hard to control how much to swing for a drop, which often popped up the ball.
                With some practice these issues got better, but I still would not classify this as a control paddle.
            </p>
            <p>The sweet spot on this paddle is also just average. Since it is a gen 1 paddle with edge foam it has a tendancy to twist easier around the edges.
                This made for an unpleasant feal near the edges, which made it harder to control. However, tungsten tape can help with this issue.
                I added 16 grams near the throat and it added much needed stability to the edges of the paddle while keeping the swingweight down.
                While the lead tape helped a bit with control, this paddle is hard to control, and makes your bad days worse compared to a control or all-court paddle.
            </p>

            </table>
            <p>This paddle is a great option if you are looking for a powerful,
                durable paddle that still has a bit more control than other power paddles.
                However, this paddle may not be for you if you struggle with control or can already generate your own power
                and may benefit from a control-oriented paddle.
