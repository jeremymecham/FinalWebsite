        <p>Hello! My name is Jeremy Mecham. I am a Computer Science Major attending Weber state University.
            I already have a BS in UX design from Utah State University, but I wanted to dive deeper into programming
            and computer science. I have done a lot of Python, some web development languages (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), and
            some SQL (MySQL and Oracle). I have always enjoyed computers and frequently modded Android phones back in the day
            by adding custom operating systems and boosting performance through overclocking. My personal hobbies include
            playing video games, playing pickleball, and generally doing anything active.

        <p>It's hard to say what video game is the best. In recent times, I would say The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.
            This game was easily one of the best games I have every played. It had an engaging story, amazing gameplay, great graphics,
            and overall felt like a great adventure.
