            <p>The Spartus Gladius Centurion has been my main paddle for several months, and it has been a fantastic paddle.
                It sits on the lower tier pricing of the Spartus paddle lineup, but don't let the cheap price tag fool you as this is a great paddle.
            </p>
            <h2>Power</h2>

            <p>This paddle has good power on drives and serves. I rarely felt that my drives and serves didn't have enough power.
                They were penetrating and went deep into the opponents court most of the time. The thermoformed construction gives the paddle
                extra pop and power compared to a gen 1 carbon fiber paddle. The spin is good on this paddle, which helps with giving the ball a nice arc to dip over the net.
            </p>
            <p>The pop on this paddle is adequate. I didn't feel it was particularly poppy, but it had enough pop most of the time.
                I never felt like I could control hand battles, but I could put away many balls with the pop the paddle gave me.
                The pop and power of this paddle gives it a good balance of enough power without sacrificing too much control.
            </p>
            <h2>Control</h2>

            <p>The control of this paddle is actually quite good. The pop was toned down for this paddle, which helps with preventing popping up the ball.
                The paddle has a plusher feel, which helps the paddle have good control. The swingweight is a bit lower than other elongated paddles,
                which makes it plow through the ball while still having good forgiveness. The slower swingweight did however make hand battles a bit harder as it was slower in your hands,
                which makes it harder to react to fast balls.
            </p>
            <p>The sweetspot is also very good. Thermoformed paddles generally have better sweetspots than gen 1, and this reigns true with this paddle.
                I did put 16 grams of tungsten tape near the throat of the paddle, which helped with twisting on off center shots. While this helped the control
                it did make the paddle a bit slower to swing. This paddle overall has good control and a good, soft feel for a thermoformed paddle.
            <h2>Who is This Paddle For?</h2>

                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>Good access to power</th>
                    <th>Higher swingweight makes paddle slower in hands</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>Good sweetspot</th>
                    <th>Pop may be too muted for some</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>Great price at $100</th>
                    <th>Good spin, but not up there with the best</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>Long handle for 2 handed backhands</th>
                    <th>Elongated shape may be harder to yield for beginners compared to standard or hybrid shapes</th>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>Overall, this is a great paddle with good attributes all around for a very affordable price. It strikes a good balance of control and power.
                I would recommend this paddle for someone who is looking for an elongated paddle with a good balance of attributes, or a former
                tennis player transitioning from tennis to pickleball. However, the swingweight and shape may be too unforgiving for certain beginners,
                and I would recommend a more forgiving and controllable paddle.
