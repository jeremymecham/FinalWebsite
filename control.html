            <ul>
                <li>Price: $100.00</li>

            <p>The Vatic Prism Flash was my main paddle for a while, and for good reason.
                When the Prism Flash came out it was widely regarded as the best paddle for $100, and I still think that it competes in the price range today.
                This paddle is often recommended for beginners, and through my playtesting and experience, I can confidently say I would recommend this to most players looking for a paddle to upgrade from their Walmart paddle.
            </p>
            <h2>Power</h2>

            <p>This paddle is definitely not a power paddle. It is a gen 1.5 construction with edge foam, so it hits harder than gen 1 carbon fiber paddles.
                However, it can't hold a candle to newer, thermoformed paddles, or even the powerful gen 1 paddles from Paddletek and Engage.
                While drives and serves felt good with this paddle I could never get enough pace off a drive or serve to win me a point.
                The ball often landed much closer than I would have liked on returns. However, this isn't to say you can't generate your own power with this paddle.
                To generate necessary power for a point-winning drive or serve I had to swing much harder than I am used to, which make me much more inconsistent.
                I mostly stuck to drops and a more control-oriented game, which this paddle excels at.
            </p>
            <p>The pop on this paddle is also very low. I would often fall behind on hand battles due to how slow the ball comes off the face.
                This paddle is much better for a control-oriented player, but certainly isn't unusable when utilizing your own power.
            </p>
            <h2>Control</h2>

            <p>The control of this paddle is fantastic. While the paddle may not be able to put as much pace on balls as other paddles it sure can help you place the ball.
                I felt wherever I pointed the paddle the ball was going exactly where I wanted it to.
                Dinks felt great, drops felt easy and consistent, and resetting was a breeze.
                I definitely find I am more consistent with a control-oriented paddle due to the access to easy control.
            </p>
            <p>The sweetspot on this paddle is also very good. It may to be able to hang with the best of the thermoformed paddles, but it certianly holds its own.
                I added 8 grams of tungsten tape to the throat, which gave the paddle a bit more stability on the edges.
                This made the paddle even easier to control due to the added stability and weight. For $100, this paddle truly is a fantastic control option.
            </p>
            <h2>Who is This Paddle For?</h2>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th class="ProCon">Pros</th>
                    <th class="ProCon">Cons</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>Great control and sweetspot</th>
                    <th>Quite low power and pop</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>Great spin</th>
                    <th>Could be too soft for certain players</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>Very affordable price at $100.00</th>
                    <th>A tad bit head heavier than other hybrid and standard shaped paddles</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th>Comes in multiple thickness options (16mm and 14mm)</th>
                    <th>May not be the best looking paddle for some players</th>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>If you are looking for a top-tier control paddle at an affordable price, this is a great option.
                This is an easy recommendation for players starting out or players who have issues with control.
                The only players I would discourage buying this paddle are players that have a hard time generating their own power, 
                and may benefit from a more powerful paddle.
